Host Definition:
A host definition is used to define a physical server, workstation, device, etc. that resides on your network.
 
Adding host definition in the host.cfg file ---> /nagios/objects/host.cfg
 
define host{
	host_name			napa_1
use				Naptech
	alias				Naptech Server
	address				123.01.11.1
	check_command			command_name_to_check
	max_check_attempts		5
	check_period			24x7
	notification_interval		30
	notification_period		24x7
	notification_options		d,u,r
	}

define host{
	host_name			napa_2
use				Naptech
	alias				Naptech Server
	address				123.01.11.2
	check_command			command_name_to_check
	max_check_attempts		5
	check_period			24x7
	notification_interval		30
	notification_period		24x7
	notification_options		d,u,r
	}

define host{
	host_name			napa_3
use				Naptech
	alias				Naptech Server
	address				123.01.11.3
	check_command			command_name_to_check
	max_check_attempts		5
	check_period			24x7
	notification_interval		30
	notification_period		24x7
	notification_options		d,u,r
	}

define host{
	host_name			napa_4
use				Naptech
	alias				Naptech Server
	address				123.01.11.4
	check_command			command_name_to_check
	max_check_attempts		5
	check_period			24x7
	notification_interval		30
	notification_period		24x7
	notification_options		d,u,r
	}

Command Definition:

Next letâ€™s define a new command to be called from a Nagios service.  This will be defined in the commands.cfg file.  (nagios/objects/commands.cfg)
 In this we will create a new command,

define command{
	command_name	check_ping
	command_line	/usr/local/nagios/libexec/check_ping -H $HOSTADDRESS$	
	}



Service Definition:

Need to create services which will call the newly created commands.  We will place these definitions in the custom-services.cfg file.  These will be very specific to the nodes you are monitoring.
This creates a service that runs on all servers.

Create four services in the service.cfg file (nagios/objects/services.cfg)

define service {

    use                  	  Naptech           ; Name of service template to use
    host_name      	  napa_1, napa_2, napa_3, napa_4
    service_description   	  PING
    check_command           <path to check interface>
}
